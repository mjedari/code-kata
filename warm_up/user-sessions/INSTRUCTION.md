# User sessions

You're in charge of implementing a new analytics "sessions" view. You're given a set of data that consists of individual web page visits, along with a visitorId which is generated by a tracking cookie that uniquely identifies each visitor. From this data we need to generate a list of sessions for each visitor.

### Input

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "url": "/pages/a-big-river",
      "visitorId": "d1177368-2310-11e8-9e2a-9b860a0d9039",
      "timestamp": 1512754583000
    },
    {
      "url": "/pages/a-small-dog",
      "visitorId": "d1177368-2310-11e8-9e2a-9b860a0d9039",
      "timestamp": 1512754631000
    },
    {
      "url": "/pages/a-big-talk",
      "visitorId": "f877b96c-9969-4abc-bbe2-54b17d030f8b",
      "timestamp": 1512709065294
    },
    {
      "url": "/pages/a-sad-story",
      "visitorId": "f877b96c-9969-4abc-bbe2-54b17d030f8b",
      "timestamp": 1512711000000
    },
    {
      "url": "/pages/a-big-river",
      "visitorId": "d1177368-2310-11e8-9e2a-9b860a0d9039",
      "timestamp": 1512754436000
    },
    {
      "url": "/pages/a-sad-story",
      "visitorId": "f877b96c-9969-4abc-bbe2-54b17d030f8b",
      "timestamp": 1512709024000
    }
  ]
}
```

Given this input data, we want to create a set of sessions of the incoming data. A sessions is defined as a group of events from a single visitor with no more than 10 minutes between each event. A visitor can have multiple sessions.

So given the example input data above, we would expect output which looks like:

### Output

```json
{
  "sessionsByUser": {
    "f877b96c-9969-4abc-bbe2-54b17d030f8b": [
      {
        "duration": 41294,
        "pages": ["/pages/a-sad-story", "/pages/a-big-talk"],
        "startTime": 1512709024000
      },
      {
        "duration": 0,
        "pages": ["/pages/a-sad-story"],
        "startTime": 1512711000000
      }
    ],
    "d1177368-2310-11e8-9e2a-9b860a0d9039": [
      {
        "duration": 195000,
        "pages": [
          "/pages/a-big-river",
          "/pages/a-big-river",
          "/pages/a-small-dog"
        ],
        "startTime": 1512754436000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Notes

- Timestamps are in milliseconds.
- Events may not be given in chronological order.
- The visitors in sessionsByUser can be in any order.
- For each visitor, sessions to be in chronological order.
- For each session, the URLs should be sorted in chronological order.
- For a session with only one event the duration should be zero
